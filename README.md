# Rainfall Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and includes various meteorological parameters that influence rainfall patterns. The analysis and model training have been carried out using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
- **File Name:** Rainfall.csv
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Description:** The dataset contains historical weather data with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant attributes that help in rainfall prediction.

## Notebook
- **File Name:** Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb
- **Description:** This Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building for rainfall prediction.

## Project Structure

```

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells to preprocess the data, perform EDA, and train the model.
3. Evaluate the model performance based on accuracy metrics.

## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into key factors influencing rainfall.
- A trained model capable of predicting rainfall based on input weather conditions.
